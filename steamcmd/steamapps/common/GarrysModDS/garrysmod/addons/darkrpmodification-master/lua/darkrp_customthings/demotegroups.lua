Demote groups
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
When a chief of police gets demoted you don't want them to be banned from becoming civil protection officer as well.
That is what demote groups are for.

When someone in a group is demoted, they will be banned from EVERY job in the group.
The examples shown below are the default demote groups

HOW TO CREATE A DEMOTE GROUP:
DarkRP.createDemoteGroup("Name of the group", {TEAM1, TEAM2})
---------------------------------------------------------------------------]]


DarkRP.createDemoteGroup("Government", {POLICE_CHIEF, SWAT_LEADER, SWAT_HEAVY, SWAT_SNIPER, SWAT_MEDIC, SWAT_MEMBER, POLICE_OFFICER})
-- Example: DarkRP.createDemoteGroup("Gangsters", {TEAM_GANG, TEAM_MOB})
