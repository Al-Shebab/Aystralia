##Installation##
This addon supports DarkRP 2.6.+  
Other newer versions should also work. If they do not, please create a ticket so this can be sorted.  

Extract "bankrobberysystem" to your addons!   

Once you've done that, you will want to set up the location of your bank vault. 

All you have to do now is launch your server, find a fitting spot for the vault, and type "bankvault\_setpos" in console.   
To move the vault around, just type the command again, at another location, and restart your server.  
It will now show up at your newest given position.  
Remember, it will set the angle of your client. So make sure you are aiming the correct way.  

##Customizing##
To customize the addons settings, go to DarkRP Bank Robbery System/lua/autorun/bank_config.lua.  
In the top of the file you can customize the settings shown below.  

BANK\_CUSTOM\_MoneyTimer = 60 -- This is the time that defines when money is added to the bank. In seconds! [Default = 60]  
BANK\_CUSTOM\_MoneyOnTime = 500 -- This is the amount of money to be added to the bank every x minutes/seconds. Defined by the setting above. [Default = 500]  
BANK\_Custom\_Max = 30000 -- The maximum the bank can have. Set to 0 for no limit. [Default = 30000]  
BANK\_Custom\_AliveTime = 5 -- The amount of MINUTES the player must stay alive before he will receive what the bank has. IN MINUTES! [Default = 5]  
BANK\_Custom\_CooldownTime = 20 -- The amount of MINUTES the bank is on a cooldown after a robbery! (Doesn't matter if the robbery failed or not) [Default = 20]  
BANK\_Custom\_RobberyDistance = 500 -- The amount of space the player can move away from the bank entity, before the bank robbery fails. [Default = 500]  
BANK\_Custom\_PlayerLimit = 1 -- The amount of players there must be on the server before you can rob the bank. [Default = 5]  
BANK\_Custom\_KillReward = 1000 -- The amount of money a person is rewarded for killing the bank robber. [Default = 1000]  
BANK\_Custom\_PoliceRequired = 3 -- The amount of police officers there must be before a person can rob the bank. [Default = 3]  
BANK\_Custom\_DropMoneyOnSucces = false -- Should money drop from the bank when a robbery is succesful? true/false option. [Default = false]

You can also customize the teams that get a notification when the vault is being robbed. There's a little table below these settings, just take a look in the file.
You can also customize the teams that are allowed to rob the bank. It's all in the same file.  

##Errors & Support##
If you find any problems with the script, please PM me with details of the situation and a copypaste of the error in console. Additionally, i rarely give additional support for my scripts. If there is a general error with the script, an error that you can prove happens, and is my fault. Send me a PM here on CoderHire. We'll figure it out there, and perhaps a chat on Steam after I've responded to your PM. I am also not interested in modifying you a custom version of the addon. Also not upon payment. Sorry!

Conflicting addons is not to be said if I will support that or not. This is something I will decide upon confrontation about a conflicting addon. If you have some sort of proof that an addon is conflicting with my addon, please send me a PM with the details you might have.

Thank you!
