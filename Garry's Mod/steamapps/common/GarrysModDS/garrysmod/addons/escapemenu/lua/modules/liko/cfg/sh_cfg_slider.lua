    *   displays a news slider block to the right of the interface which will cycle through various

    *       determines if the slider will be visible at all
    *
    *   :   cfg.slider.host
    *       this is utilized when you own multiple scripts with the same slider feature.
    *       setting ONE of the scripts cfg.slider.host = true will make ALL scripts
    *       grab the slider and color information from the host script. this keeps you from having
    *       to configure each and every one.
    *
    *   :   cfg.slider.host_define
    *       specifies which module will be the hoster of the data.
    *       setting this means that multiple scripts with a slider feature can share the slider
    *       information so that you dont have to configure each one individually.
    *

    *       amount of padding to give to content within the rounded box.
    *       the higher the number, the bigger the gap between edge of box and content
