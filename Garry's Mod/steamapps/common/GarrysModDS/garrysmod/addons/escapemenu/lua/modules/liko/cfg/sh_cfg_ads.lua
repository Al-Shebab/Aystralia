    *   this allows you to place video ads on your motd that are either sourced with youtube or webm format.
    *
    *   ensure that you enable only one method at a time, otherwise one will override the other and it may
    *   cause confusion.
    *
    *   :   WARNING
    *       due to gmod using an outdated copy of awesomium, youtube videos may not function properly and
    *       will throw back an HTML5 error. this is completely out of our control.
    *
    *       however, webm files do still work and will load properly if linked to a working video. you have
    *       the option to download a video on youtube and then use a free service to convert it to webm and
    *       then upload the converted webm to your host server.
    *
    *       free services:
    *           : youtube to mp4  =>  https://www.onlinevideoconverter.com/youtube-converter
    *           : mp4 to webm     =>  https://video.online-convert.com/convert-to-webm
    *
    *       converted webm can be resolutions of:
    *           : 640w x 360h
    *           : 320w x 180h
    *
    *       anything bigger appears will not render and videos will display as a black screen
