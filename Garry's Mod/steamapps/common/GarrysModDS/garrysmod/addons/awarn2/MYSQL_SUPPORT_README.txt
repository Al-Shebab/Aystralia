If you would like to use the support for MySQL you NEED to follow these steps. Please do not ask for help if you did not follow these steps!


1. In your MySQL server, create a new database for Awarn2. In my example, I use awarn2 (You can use an existing database if you wish)
2. Make sure you have an SQL user that has read and write access to that database.
3. Run your server at least once to generate the settings file, then open it. It can be found in garrysmod/data/awarn2/settings/mysql_settings.txt
4. Edit the config with the information for your MySQL server.
5. Restart your server and if configured properly, AWarn2 will create the tables inside of your database and will use those.
	
Enjoy!
